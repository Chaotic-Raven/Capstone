# Capstone
This is a showcase of a portion of my Capstone for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science degree.

The original project was one I had made in a prior course that I took and modified and added additional functionality to.

The original project utilized python to take JSON data from CURL requests modify a MongoDB database of mock stock information. It could create, read, update, and delete "stock" entries within the database. This was not very intitive for a user, so I took the project and expanded upon it by making a website interface that would allow you to create, read, update, and delete entries in the database easily.
